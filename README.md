# Frontend Portfolio

## Introduction

Welcome to my Frontend Portfolio Repository!

This repository serves as a showcase of my skills and capabilities in frontend development, featuring two distinct projects that demonstrate my proficiency with modern web technologies. Each project within this portfolio is built with a focus on responsive design, user experience, and leveraging the full potential of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, TypeScript, and Chakra UI among other tools.

**Gamepedia** is a dynamic game catalog leveraging the rawg.io API to provide real-time data on a vast array of video games, highlighting my skills in API integration and responsive UI design.

**TypoTrack** offers an interactive typing experience, designed to improve typing skills with real-time feedback, showcasing my proficiency in developing web tools focused on user needs.

Both projects are testament to my commitment to clean code, thoughtful design, and the creation of engaging, user-friendly web applications. Whether you're a fellow developer, a potential employer, or just a tech enthusiast, I invite you to explore these projects to get a sense of my approach to problem-solving and design in the realm of frontend development.
